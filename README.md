This repository contains SolidWorks parts used in the construction of a custom-designed lamp.
It marks my first experience in creating a mechanical drawing, completed digitally. 
Furthermore, I successfully carried out the entire design process, from conception to execution. 
The components are largely self-explanatory, with the "duiholder" and "switchholder" serving as internal fixtures to secure the switch and DUI mechanism in place.
